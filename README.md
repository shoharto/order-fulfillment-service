# Order Fulfillment Service

- Precise problem statement
- High level spec: flow chart, block diagrams etc.
- Low level spec: ERD, schema definitions, sequence diagrams(sync and async flows) etc.
- Choice of stack: which one is for what?
- API Spec: RESTful APIs and event payloads(use `swagger` if possible)
- All included in a repository in github; all can be put inside a folder called `architecture`
- A possible folder structure:
```
architecture
- hld
  - flow-chart.jpg
  - block-diagram.jpg
- lld
  - erd.jpg
  - ...
- api-spec
  - swagger.json
  - events.md
- stack.md
- solution-brief.md
